This is a week-3 assigment project for IDS706 by Anastasiia Saenko (as1466 Duke NetId).
The project is built upon week-1 Python CI/CD template and uses Week-2 project as a  baseline to convert pandas based code to Polars Python code. The project includes folllowing files: 

* Devcontainer with DockerFile
* workflows with github actions
* gitingnore file
* this Readme.md file
* requirements.txt file
* main.py file with the polars script and test_main.py with cases for this script.
* [Statistics_report.md](https://github.com/nogibjj/as1466_week3_DE/blob/main/Statistics_report.md) - autogenerated Summary statistics report built on converted (pandas -> polars) functions.
* [bmi.csv](https://github.com/nogibjj/as1466_week3_DE/blob/main/bmi.csv) - dataframe used in this mini-project

The sample report is provided below.
